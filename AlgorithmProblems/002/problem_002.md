Leetcode prblem: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse its digits.

### Examples:

```
Input: 3452
Output: 2543
```
```
Input: -678
Output: -876
```
```
Input:420
Output: 24
```

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
